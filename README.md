# Libft

This is the second project of the course 42. It consists in realizing a library in C which will contain many basic functions that we will reuse during the following projects. To compile the library, clone the repo and run the "make" command. You will get the library as .a. You can add this .a when compiling your C files to use the functions it contains.
