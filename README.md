# Libft

This is the first project of the course 42. It consists of a creator of a C library which will contain many basic functions that we will reuse in the following projects. To compile the library, clone the repo and run the "make" command. You will get the library as .a. You can add this .a when compiling your C files to use the functions it contains.
